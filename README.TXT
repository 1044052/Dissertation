The directory "pKa_convergence_plots" include the pka convergence plots of all ionizable residues 
(Asp, Glu, His, Lys and Cys) in 2ns.
 

The files "training_set_pka.csv" and "validation_set_pka.cvs" 
contain the pka's for Asp, Glu, His and Lys that are converged.

Here a pKa is said converged if the pKa change during the last 0.5ns is smaller than 0.2, 
  

Note, the pKa's of Cys are not converged in 2ns, thus Cys is not considered by the present model.
